  <h1>Hello, World.</h1>

	<h2>About Me (Lauren MacGuidwin)</h2>
  <!-- I don't know how to get the drop letter to align properly with the text that comes in the same sentence & the next sectcion. Tried clear: left/right and it wasn't working for me ... do these need to be in their own <div> sections for the functions to work? I didn't really understand the explanation in class.-->

		<p><span class= "firstletter">23</span> in New York City. Somewhere between DC, SF, and NYC for the past 5 years. I do user experience work at a digital agency called <a href="www.razorfish.com">Razorfish</a>.</p>

	<h2>On a Mission (Statement)</h2>

	<img class="displayed" src="assets/Unicorn.jpg" width=250 height=200>
		<p>After taking this course, I'll have extended my capabilities more closely towards that of a "unicorn." A unicorn is a candidate with multiple capabilities in areas like UX, visual design, and coding. A few of my freelance clients continue to ask for web development help, and this course will help me to help them.</p>

	<h2>Value Proposition</h2>
		<p>I'm a curious UX associate who learns from human experience and the changing consciousness of our world. Soon enough, I'll have the chops to imagine, sketch, AND build the framework for stellar interactions between users and businesses. As a frequent traveler and forever student, I know how to adapt to new skills and technologies under a state of constant flux.</p>
