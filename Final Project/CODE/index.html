          <h2>About This Project</h2> 

               <p>People who write down their goals are more likely to achieve them; I was curious how far I could go by coding them.</p>

                    <p>Learning shouldn't stop after graduation, and traveling hones appreciation for the joys of being home. We are given little time to explore a vast expanse of earth and emotion; let's not waste it.</p>

                          <p>This is not a comprehensive list, and I happily take suggestions at LMacGuidwin at Gmail.</p>

          <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>I do user experience at Razorfish in a tiny town called Manhattan. This is my final project for the front-end web development course I took at General Assembly. See more of my work on <a href="http://www.laurenmacguidwin.com/design/" target="_blank">my site</a>.</p> 

          <h5>Background Photo:</h5> 

                <p>The Longsheng Rice Terraces in southern China, during the first month of my first solo backpacking trip. Locals refer to them as the "Dragon's Backbone" because they appear to be the spinal ridges of a massive beast.</p>
