	<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>23 in New York City. Somewhere between DC, SF, and NYC for the past 5 years. I do user experience work at a digital agency called <a href="www.razorfish.com">Razorfish</a>.</p>

	<h2>On a Mission (Statement)</h2>
	<img class="displayed" src="assets/Unicorn.jpg" width=300 height=200>
		<p>After taking this course, I'll have extended my capabilities more closely towards that of a "unicorn." (Pic) A unicorn is a candidate with multiple capabilities in areas like UX, visual design, and coding. A few of my freelance clients continue to ask for web development help, and this course will help me to help them.</p>

	<h2>Value Proposition</h2>
		<p>I'm a curious UX associate who learns from human experience and the changing consciousness of our world. Soon enough, I'll have the chops to imagine, sketch, AND build the framework for stellar interactions between users and businesses. As a frequent traveler and forever student, I know how to adapt to new skills and technologies under a state of constant flux.</p>
